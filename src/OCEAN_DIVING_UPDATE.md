## 📱 Responsive Design

All ocean effects are fully responsive:

- ✅ Canvas scales to screen size
- ✅ Particle counts adjust for performance
- ✅ Wave amplitudes scale proportionally
- ✅ Touch-optimized for mobile
- ✅ Efficient rendering on all devices

---

## 🎯 Performance Optimizations

### Canvas Rendering:
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps
- Efficient drawing with minimal repaints
- Optimized gradient calculations

### Animation Performance:
- GPU-accelerated CSS transforms
- `will-change` properties where needed
- Debounced scroll events
- Lazy rendering of off-screen elements

### Memory Management:
- Proper cleanup of animation frames
- Event listener removal on unmount
- Efficient particle recycling
