2. **Visual Storytelling**: Each section tells part of the ocean conservation story
3. **Technical Excellence**: Optimized animations, lazy loading, performance-first
4. **Unique Elements**: 
   - Celestial reflection on ocean (sun/moon)
   - Interactive ocean depth explorer
   - Real-time ocean health map
   - Trackable action commitment system
5. **Cohesive Design System**: Every element follows the ocean theme

7. **Mobile-First**: Fully responsive and touch-optimized

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

- **Motion Optimization**: Uses `useScroll` and `useTransform` for 60fps animations
